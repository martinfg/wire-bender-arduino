## Description
Firmware for Arduino to work with [WireBenderControl](https://github.com/martinfg/WireBenderControl) software. It very loosley builds upon the "original" firmware developed by [How To Mechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-3d-wire-bending-machine/) and partly extends the [Simple Arduino Serial Protocol](https://github.com/araffin/arduino-robust-serial) on which you can read up here in this [medium](https://medium.com/@araffin/simple-and-robust-computer-arduino-serial-communication-f91b95596788) article.
